## Objective

Junior Data Scientist with an engineering background and practical experience in analytics, machine learning, and large language models. I prefer working with real-world data and building solutions like recommender systems and classifiers. Currently learning computer vision and planning to grow in both LLM and CV domains. Open to data roles that combine technical work with meaningful, applied outcomes.

## Projects

### Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Internship – W Focus)  
Developing a multilingual chatbot using FastAPI and models from Hugging Face. Implemented RAG architecture with custom prompt templates. For embedding storage, tested both FAISS and MongoDB Atlas. The system performs semantic search over internal documents and generates context-aware responses using a local inference setup.

### Lightweight RAG Chatbot (Personal Demo Project)  
<a href="https://github.com/Gutalina/PDF-chatbot.git" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
Built a simplified RAG-based chatbot as a demo. Used two local models via Ollama — one for embedding generation and one for answer generation. The project includes custom prompt formatting and supports multilingual input. Designed for demonstration purposes and reproducibility with minimal setup.

### LLM Response Classifier (Kaggle Competition)  
Trained a classifier to determine which of two LLM-generated responses is better. Used sentence embeddings (`paraphrase-multilingual`) and a Keras neural classifier.  
Working on a PyTorch/Transformers version that finetunes a pretrained RoBERTa encoder with a classification head. This version is being developed for submission to a Kaggle competition on LLM response evaluation.

### E-commerce Client Segmentation and Recommender System  
<a href="https://github.com/Gutalina/Clustering_and_recommender_system.git" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
Segmented customers using RFM features and K-Means. Built recommendation models: SVD, popularity-based, and neural collaborative filtering. Integrated product metadata to improve suggestions.

### Barcelona Traffic Accidents Analysis  
<a href="https://github.com/Gutalina/Traffic_Accidents_Barcelona.git" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
Performed statistical analysis on traffic accident data in Barcelona. Compared accident frequency and severity across neighborhoods using hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

### Airbnb Rental Market Analysis  
<a href="https://github.com/Gutalina/Airbnb_EDA.git" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
Explored trends in pricing and illegal listings using public Airbnb data. Combined SQL, Pandas, and Plotly express to present the influence of tourism and neighborhood-specific risks.
